This is my IGCSE Grade 11 Design and Communication Project. I'm working on Theme 10: "Consider the situation where a company that manufactures computer games and accessories requires a point of sale display stand for a hand-held controller complete with a rechargeable battery pack." If you check out the date of this repository you'll get to know that I'm a bit late, 
but hey, I work best on tight deadlines :P.

## Other IGCSE Projects

While these projects are quite old(2008-2007, the syllabus has changed a **LOT** since then), they will provide you with an **idea** of how to proceed with your folio & model. Do NOT copy or completely base your work on these projects; you'll lose a lot of marks as they do not meet a lot of recently added requirements.
